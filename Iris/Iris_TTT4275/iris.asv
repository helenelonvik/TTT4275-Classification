1. Design/training and generalization
    a. 30 samples for training and the last 20 samples for testing was defined. 
    b. The linear classifier described in subchapter 2.4 and 3.2 was tuned, resulting in the step factor alpha = 0.1. 
       This lead to convergence for the training, and was found by plotting both the MSE and MSE gradient. 
    c. The confusion matrix and the error rate for both the training and the test set was found. This gave the matrices:

Training confusion matrix:
