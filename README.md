# TTT4275-Classification

A project in the course TTT4275 - Classification. 

## Part 1 - The Iris task

This first part of the project puts focus on the design and evaluation of a linear classifier. Further one should analyze the relative importance of each of the four feature with respect to linear separability.

## Part 2 - Classification of handwritten numbers 0-9

The task consists of two parts both using variants of a nearest neighbourhood classifier. In the first part the whole training set shall be used as templates. In the second part we use clustering to produce a small(er) set of templates for each class.
